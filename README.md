## Known Issues

There are a number of known issues and changes required to the official OpenAPI spec to generate useful client
libraries.

These are all codified in `update-spec.py` which can be used to obtain the latest OpenAPI Specification from a running
Sonatype IQ Server, apply the required modifications and transform from JSON to YAML - outputting the result
to `spec/openapi.yml`.

The below subsections document these changes and limitations - but you should rely on `update-spec.py` primarily.

### APIs Excluded from Generation

The following API endpoints are removed from the schema prior to generation of the API Client libraries.

| API Endpoint                                               | Method | Reason                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /api/v2/licenseLegalMetadata/customMultiApplication/report | POST   | Relies on a schema of undefined `object` - generated code is invalid in Typescript. |
| /api/v2/product/license                                    | POST   | Relies on a schema of undefined `object` - generated code is invalid in Typescript. |
| /api/v2/product/license                                    | DELETE | Relies on a schema of undefined `object` - generated code is invalid in Typescript. |
| /api/v2/config/saml                                        | PUT    | Relies on a schema of undefined `object` - generated code is invalid in Typescript. |

### Additional Changes to OpenAPI Schema prior to Generation

*See `update-spec.py` for all changes.*

## Getting the latest OpenAPI Schema

Get it from your Sonatype IQ Server at `/api/v2/endpoints/public`.

## Generation of API Clients

```
docker run --rm -v "$(PWD):/local" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli batch --clean /local/typescript.yaml

docker run --rm -v "$(PWD):/local" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i /local/spec/openapi.yaml -g typescript-fetch -o /local/out/test -c /local/openapi-config.yaml -v > out.log
```

## Diagnosing Responses that are not Schema Compliant

In the rare event that Sonatype IQ Server provides a response that does not validate against the schema (our patched
schema to be clear), things can be silent - you just never get a response in your code.

Through the use of [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
and [opeapi-request-response-validation](https://github.com/gcatanese/openapi-request-response-validation) project
by [Beppe Catanese](https://github.com/gcatanese), we can quickly and accurately see where response validation failures
occur.

1. Configure the request for which you are not getting a response in Postman exactly as it was sent
2. To that request (you can do this in a Collection if you are using Collections too), add a Test with the code:
   ```
    // define object
    openapiRequestResponseValidation = {
    // define function
    validate: function(pm) {

        const postRequest = {
            url: 'http://localhost:8080/validate',
            method: 'POST',
            header: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
            body: {
            mode: 'raw',
            raw: JSON.stringify({ 
                method: pm.request.method, 
                path: pm.request.url.getPath(),
                headers: pm.request.headers,
                requestAsJson: (pm.request.body != "") ? pm.request.body.raw : null,
                responseAsJson: pm.response.text(),
                statusCode: pm.response.code
                })
            }
        };

        pm.sendRequest(postRequest, (error, response) => {
            if(error != undefined) {
                pm.expect.fail('Unexpected error ' + error);
            } else {
                var data = response.json();

                if(data.valid == false) {
                    console.log(data.errors);
                }

                pm.test("OpenAPI validation", () => {
                    pm.expect(data.valid, "Invalid request/response (check Console)").to.equal(true);
                });

            }
        });  
      }
    };

    // invoke function
    openapiRequestResponseValidation.validate(pm);
3. Start the `openapi-request-response-validation` Container locally:
   ```
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ./spec:/openapi -it --rm gcatanese/openapi-request-response-validation
   ```
4. Execute the request in Postman - if the test does not show as passed then you can get details of the failure from two
   places:
    1. The Postman console
    2. The logs from the running Container

## Changelog

See our [Change Log](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Releasing

We use [semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to generate releases
from commits to the `main` branch.

We aim to keep the MINOR version component in-line with the version of Nexus IQ Server for which the API Client is
generated - i.e. `1.156.x` are all releases generated for the API specification as shipped with Sonatype IQ Server
version 156.

For example, to perform a "patch" release, add a commit to `main` with a comment like below. The `fix: ` prefix matters.

```
fix: the problem resolved goes here
```

## The Fine Print

Remember:

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours to the open source
community (read: you!)

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to `nexus-iq-api-client`
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all - have fun!
